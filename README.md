# PianoVelocity
Plays sound font sounds, taking into account the force the device was pressed with.
Velocity is based on information taken from Accelerator data.

This is a very simple example, and please do not use this as a development pattern. 
In reality the accelerator data should be coming from its own class, 
and general key/screen button pressed value -> midi sound should be contained separately. 
However, for the simplicity of the example - I have mashed all of these functions together in a single file. 
This is now how real production code should be written. This is just an example!
